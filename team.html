				<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				<p>During the COVID 19 pandemic, many students are unable to get the summer experience that they planned for. With education shifting to a video-based format, students are losing interest and motivation. Even worse is the number of students unable to pay for classes due to financial hardships. </p>
				<p>As a service to the community, Codepioneers is offering free Python courses which are beginner friendly! Our unique teaching style focuses on hands-on coding from the very first class, which is designed to increase student participation and enthusiasm. Live and interactive virtual lessons taught by skilled instructors keep students engaged. And with a small student to teacher ratio, students receive individual attention. This means a fully interactive and hands-on experience with no boring videos! </p>
